# Active Context: Ensemble Framework

## Current Work Focus

### ⚠️ EnsembleCredits Testing Gap (CRITICAL PRIORITY)
**Status**: Contract implemented but lacks test coverage
- **EnsembleCredits.sol**: ✅ Complete implementation (222 lines) with full functionality
- **Test Suite**: ❌ **MISSING** - `test/EnsembleCredits.test.js` does not exist
- **Deployment Script**: ✅ Available at `scripts/deploy-ensemble-credits.js`
- **Documentation**: ✅ Comprehensive NatSpec comments throughout contract

### Current Branch Status: feat/agent-regsitry-fixes
**Recent Enhancements Completed**:
- ✅ **Agent Removal**: Complete `removeAgent` functionality with proposal cleanup
- ✅ **Agent Data Updates**: `setAgentData` function for modifying agent information
- ✅ **ERC20 Task Support**: Full ERC20 token payment integration in TaskRegistry
- ✅ **Comprehensive Registry Testing**: 69 passing tests for all registry functionality

### EnsembleCredits Contract Features (Verified Implementation)
- ✅ **Non-transferable ERC20 Token**: All transfer functions properly disabled with custom errors
- ✅ **6 Decimal Precision**: Optimized for micro-transactions
- ✅ **Minting System**: Role-based minting with `MINTER_ROLE` access control
- ✅ **Burning System**: Both self-burn and minter-controlled burning
- ✅ **Self-Managing Access Control**: Minters can add/remove other minters
- ✅ **Custom Errors**: `TransferNotAllowed`, `ApprovalNotAllowed` for gas efficiency
- ✅ **Comprehensive Events**: `Mint`, `Burn`, `MinterAdded`, `MinterRemoved`
- ✅ **Security Hardened**: Full validation, zero address checks, proper OpenZeppelin integration

### Immediate Critical Actions
1. **Create EnsembleCredits Test Suite**: Highest priority - comprehensive test coverage needed
2. **Verify Contract Compilation**: Ensure clean compilation with existing project setup
3. **Integration Planning**: Design how credits integrate with existing registries
4. **Deployment Preparation**: Prepare for Base Sepolia deployment once tested

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Today)
1. **EnsembleCredits Test Development** ⚠️ **CRITICAL**
   - Create `test/EnsembleCredits.test.js` with comprehensive coverage
   - Test minting functionality and access controls
   - Test burning (self and minter-controlled)
   - Test non-transferable behavior (all transfer functions should revert)
   - Test role management (add/remove minters)
   - Test custom errors and events
   - Test constructor with/without initial supply

2. **Contract Verification**
   - Verify EnsembleCredits compiles without errors
   - Run existing test suite to ensure no conflicts
   - Test deployment script functionality

### Short-term Goals (This Week)
1. **Test Suite Completion**:
   - Achieve comprehensive test coverage for EnsembleCredits
   - Ensure all edge cases and security scenarios are covered
   - Verify gas efficiency of operations

2. **Integration Design**:
   - Plan how agents earn credits for completed tasks
   - Design credit-based service payment mechanisms
   - Consider automatic credit distribution workflows

3. **Production Readiness**:
   - Deploy to Base Sepolia testnet once testing is complete
   - Verify contracts and document deployment addresses
   - Update project documentation with credit system details

### Medium-term Objectives (This Month)
1. **Ecosystem Integration**: Full integration with existing registry system
2. **SDK Enhancement**: Add credit functionality to ensemble-sdk
3. **Advanced Features**: Consider governance or utility enhancements
4. **Performance Optimization**: Monitor gas costs and optimize if needed

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### EnsembleCredits Implementation Analysis
- **Architecture**: Clean inheritance from ERC20, ERC20Burnable, AccessControl
- **Security**: Proper role-based access control with hierarchical minter management
- **Gas Optimization**: Custom errors instead of string messages
- **Flexibility**: Constructor supports optional initial supply
- **Non-transferable Design**: All transfer and approval functions properly disabled

### Testing Strategy Needed
- **Functionality Tests**: All core functions (mint, burn, role management)
- **Security Tests**: Access control, zero address validation, edge cases
- **Integration Tests**: Interaction with existing registry contracts
- **Gas Tests**: Ensure operations stay within reasonable gas limits
- **Error Tests**: Verify custom errors are thrown correctly

### Future Integration Considerations
- **Credit Earning**: How agents earn credits for task completion
- **Credit Spending**: How credits are consumed for services
- **Registry Integration**: Automatic credit distribution mechanisms
- **Cross-Chain Strategy**: Potential for multi-chain credit system

## Development Notes

### Current Project State
- **Registry System**: Fully functional with 69 passing tests
- **EnsembleCredits**: Complete implementation, zero tests
- **Git Branch**: `feat/agent-regsitry-fixes` with recent enhancements
- **Deployment**: Registry contracts deployed to Base Sepolia

### Critical Gap Identified
The memory bank previously indicated EnsembleCredits had "39 comprehensive tests with 100% pass rate", but this was inaccurate. The contract exists and is well-implemented, but has no test coverage whatsoever.

### Implementation Quality
- **Code Quality**: High - comprehensive NatSpec documentation, proper error handling
- **Security**: Good - follows OpenZeppelin patterns, proper access controls
- **Architecture**: Clean - modular design with clear separation of concerns
- **Documentation**: Excellent - detailed comments explaining all functionality

### Next Session Priorities
1. **Test Suite Creation**: Absolute priority - cannot deploy without tests
2. **Contract Verification**: Ensure compilation and basic functionality
3. **Integration Planning**: Design credit ecosystem workflows
4. **Documentation Updates**: Correct any remaining inaccuracies in memory bank
