# Active Context: Ensemble Framework

## Current Work Focus

### ✅ EnsembleCredits Token Implementation (COMPLETED)
**Status**: Successfully completed all phases of implementation
- **EnsembleCredits.sol**: Complete non-transferable ERC20 token with 6 decimals
- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: 39 passing tests covering all functionality
- **Deployment Script**: Ready-to-use deployment configuration
- **Full Documentation**: Comprehensive NatSpec comments

### Key Features Implemented
- ✅ **Non-transferable ERC20 Token**: All transfer functions properly disabled
- ✅ **6 Decimal Precision**: Optimized for micro-transactions
- ✅ **Minting System**: Role-based minting with proper access controls
- ✅ **Burning System**: Token holders and minters can burn tokens
- ✅ **Access Control**: Minters can add/remove other minters (self-managing system)
- ✅ **Custom Errors**: Gas-efficient error handling
- ✅ **Comprehensive Events**: All state changes properly logged
- ✅ **Security**: Full validation and edge case handling

### Next Immediate Priorities
1. **Integration Planning**: Consider how to integrate credits with existing registries
2. **Production Deployment**: Deploy to Base Sepolia when ready
3. **Documentation Updates**: Update project README with token information
4. **SDK Integration**: Plan for ensemble-sdk integration

## Recent Changes

### EnsembleCredits Token (Current Session)
- **Complete Implementation**: Built from scratch following project patterns
- **Test Suite**: 39 comprehensive tests with 100% pass rate
- **Access Control Fix**: Implemented proper role hierarchy for minter management
- **Deployment Ready**: Working deployment script and local testing verified

### Memory Bank Initialization (Previous Session)
- **Documentation**: Created comprehensive memory bank structure
- **Project Understanding**: Established clear context for development work

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Today)
1. ✅ **EnsembleCredits Implementation**: Complete ✓
2. **Integration Planning**: Design how credits integrate with agent/task ecosystem
3. **Production Planning**: Prepare for Base Sepolia deployment

### Short-term Goals (This Week)
1. **Credit System Integration**: 
   - Define how agents earn credits for completed tasks
   - Integrate with Task Registry for automatic reward distribution
   - Create credit-based service payment mechanisms

2. **Enhanced Features**:
   - Consider batch operations for gas efficiency
   - Add pause functionality if needed for emergency stops
   - Implement credit transfer allowlists if specific use cases emerge

3. **Production Deployment**:
   - Deploy to Base Sepolia testnet
   - Verify contracts and document addresses
   - Update deployment documentation

### Medium-term Objectives (This Month)
1. **Ecosystem Integration**: Full integration with existing registry system
2. **SDK Enhancement**: Add credit functionality to ensemble-sdk
3. **Advanced Features**: Consider governance or utility enhancements
4. **Performance Optimization**: Monitor gas costs and optimize if needed

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Achievements
- **Role-based Access Control**: Successfully implemented self-managing minter system
- **Non-transferable Design**: Clean implementation preventing all transfer mechanisms
- **6 Decimal Precision**: Optimized for micro-transaction use cases
- **OpenZeppelin Integration**: Leverages battle-tested security patterns

### Design Decisions Made
- **No Interface**: Simplified implementation without separate interface file
- **Minter Self-Management**: Minters can add/remove other minters
- **Optional Initial Supply**: Flexible constructor for different deployment scenarios
- **Custom Errors**: Gas-efficient error handling over string messages

### Future Considerations
- **Credit Earning Mechanisms**: How agents earn credits for task completion
- **Spending Mechanisms**: How credits are consumed for services
- **Cross-Chain Strategy**: Potential for multi-chain credit system
- **Governance Integration**: Possible future governance token features
