# Active Context: Ensemble Framework

## Current Work Focus

### Memory Bank Initialization
**Status**: âœ… Complete
- Created comprehensive memory bank structure
- Documented all core files: projectbrief, productContext, systemPatterns, techContext
- Established foundation for future development tracking

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Code Analysis**: Review existing smart contracts for patterns and architecture
2. **Testing Strategy**: Assess current test coverage and identify gaps
3. **Documentation**: Create inline documentation for complex contract logic
4. **Optimization**: Identify gas optimization opportunities

## Recent Changes

### Version Status Update (Current Session)
- **v3 Promotion**: v3 is now the current stable release
- **v2 Deprecation**: v2 is deprecated and no longer recommended for new integrations
- **Memory Bank Updates**: Updated documentation to reflect current version status

### Memory Bank Creation (Previous Session)
- **projectbrief.md**: Established core project objectives and requirements
- **productContext.md**: Defined problem space and user experience goals
- **systemPatterns.md**: Documented architectural patterns and design decisions
- **techContext.md**: Outlined technology stack and development environment
- **activeContext.md**: Current state tracking
- **progress.md**: Comprehensive status tracking

### Project State
- Two versions deployed on Base Sepolia (v2 stable, v3 next)
- Core registries implemented: Agent, Task, Service
- Hardhat development environment configured
- Multi-network deployment support established

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Today)
1. Complete memory bank with progress.md
2. Analyze existing smart contract implementations
3. Review test coverage and identify testing gaps
4. Create development workflow documentation

### Short-term Goals (This Week)
1. **Code Quality Review**: 
   - Audit existing contracts for security patterns
   - Identify gas optimization opportunities
   - Review error handling and edge cases

2. **Testing Enhancement**:
   - Expand test coverage for edge cases
   - Add integration tests for multi-contract workflows
   - Implement property-based testing for critical functions

3. **Documentation Improvement**:
   - Add comprehensive NatSpec comments
   - Create developer integration guides
   - Document deployment procedures

### Medium-term Objectives (This Month)
1. **Security Hardening**: Prepare contracts for professional audit
2. **Performance Optimization**: Reduce gas costs across all operations
3. **Feature Enhancement**: Implement advanced capability matching
4. **Integration Support**: Expand SDK functionality

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions Pending
- **Upgradability Strategy**: Evaluate proxy patterns vs. immutable contracts
- **Event Optimization**: Balance between detailed logging and gas costs
- **Access Control Granularity**: Define roles and permissions structure
- **Cross-Chain Strategy**: Plan for multi-chain deployment coordination

### Current Blockers
- None identified at this time

### Dependencies
- Ensemble SDK development (external team)
- Network deployment approvals
- Security audit scheduling

## Development Notes

### Code Style Preferences
- Explicit function visibility modifiers
- Comprehensive NatSpec documentation
- Consistent naming conventions (CamelCase contracts, PascalCase interfaces)
- Event emission for all state changes
- Custom errors over revert strings

### Testing Approach
- Unit tests for individual contract functions
- Integration tests for cross-contract workflows
- Property-based testing for critical mathematical operations
- Gas consumption monitoring
- Edge case coverage for security-critical functions

### Performance Targets
- Sub-50k gas for basic registration operations
- Sub-100k gas for complex task assignment operations
- Optimized storage layouts for frequently accessed data
- Minimal external calls to reduce gas overhead
