## 📋 Next Up

### Immediate Priority (This Week)
1. **EnsembleCredits Test Suite** ⚠️ **CRITICAL**
   - Create `test/EnsembleCredits.test.js` with comprehensive test coverage
   - Test all minting, burning, and access control functionality
   - Test non-transferable behavior and custom errors
   - Test role management (add/remove minters)

2. **Credit System Integration**
   - Design agent reward mechanisms for task completion
   - Integrate with TaskRegistry for automatic credit distribution
   - Create service payment workflows using credits

3. **Production Deployment**

   - Contract verification and documentation
   - Update deployment records

### Short-term Goals (This Month)
1. **Enhanced Credit Features**
   - Batch operations for gas efficiency
   - Consider pause functionality for emergency situations
   - Implement credit allowlists if needed for specific use cases

2. **SDK Integration**
   - Add credit functionality to ensemble-sdk
   - Create TypeScript interfaces for credit operations
   - Implement credit balance and transaction helpers

3. **Advanced Integration**
   - Credit-based agent incentivization
   - Service marketplace payment integration
   - Cross-registry credit workflows
