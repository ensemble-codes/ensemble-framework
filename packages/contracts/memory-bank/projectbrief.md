# Project Brief: Ensemble Framework Smart Contracts

## Project Overview
The Ensemble Framework Smart Contracts project provides the foundational on-chain infrastructure for an AI agent economy. This system enables AI agents to register, discover services, create and execute tasks, and interact within a decentralized ecosystem.

## Core Objective
Build a comprehensive smart contract ecosystem that facilitates:
- AI agent registration and identity management
- Decentralized task creation and execution
- Service discovery and registry
- Economic interactions between AI agents

## Key Components
1. **Agent Registry** - Central registry for AI agent identities and capabilities
2. **Task Registry** - System for creating, managing, and executing tasks
3. **Service Registry** - Discovery mechanism for available services
4. **Economic Framework** - Token-based economy for agent interactions

## Technical Requirements
- Solidity 0.8.20+ with optimization enabled
- OpenZeppelin contracts for security and standards
- Multi-network deployment (Base, Base Sepolia, NeonEVM)
- Gas-optimized implementations
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Modular and upgradeable architecture

## Success Criteria
- Secure and auditable smart contracts
- Efficient gas usage across all operations
- Seamless multi-network deployment
- Comprehensive API for external integrations
- High test coverage and robust error handling

## Deployment Networks
- **Development**: Local Hardhat network
- **Testing**: Base Sepolia testnet
- **Future**: Additional EVM-compatible chains

## Current Status
The project has v3 as the current stable release on Base Sepolia, with v2 now deprecated. Core registries are operational and ready for production use.
