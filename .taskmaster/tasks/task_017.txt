# Task ID: 17
# Title: Fix failing API tests in packages/api/src/routes/agents.test.ts
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 16
# Priority: medium
# Description: Debug and resolve failing test cases in the agents route test suite to ensure all API endpoints are properly tested and validated.
# Details:
1. Analyze the current test failures in packages/api/src/routes/agents.test.ts by running the test suite and identifying specific error messages, assertion failures, or timeout issues.

2. Update test mocks and fixtures to align with the new SDK integration implemented in Task 16:
   - Replace any hardcoded mock data with realistic test data that matches SDK response formats
   - Update test assertions to expect actual blockchain data structures instead of mock responses
   - Mock the @ensemble/sdk methods properly using jest.mock() or similar testing framework mocking capabilities

3. Fix test setup and teardown procedures:
   - Ensure proper test database/blockchain state initialization before each test
   - Add cleanup procedures to reset state between tests
   - Configure test environment variables for testnet connections if needed

4. Address authentication and authorization test scenarios:
   - Update tests to handle any new authentication requirements
   - Mock authentication tokens or user sessions as needed
   - Test both authenticated and unauthenticated request scenarios

5. Update test assertions for error handling:
   - Verify that API endpoints return appropriate HTTP status codes
   - Test error response formats match the expected API contract
   - Ensure blockchain connection failures are handled gracefully in tests

6. Add missing test coverage for any new endpoints or functionality:
   - Test all CRUD operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for agent routes
   - Add edge case testing for invalid inputs, malformed requests, and boundary conditions
   - Test rate limiting, pagination, and query parameter handling if applicable

# Test Strategy:
1. Run the failing test suite to establish baseline failure count and specific error messages: `npm test packages/api/src/routes/agents.test.ts --verbose`

2. Fix tests incrementally and verify each fix:
   - Run individual test cases to isolate and resolve specific failures
   - Use `--watch` mode during development for rapid feedback
   - Ensure each test passes consistently across multiple runs

3. Validate test coverage and quality:
   - Run coverage reports to ensure all code paths in agents routes are tested
   - Verify that tests cover both success and failure scenarios
   - Check that mocked SDK methods are called with expected parameters

4. Integration testing validation:
   - Run tests against a test environment with actual SDK integration
   - Verify that tests work with both mocked and real SDK responses
   - Test with different network conditions and error scenarios

5. Regression testing:
   - Run the full API test suite to ensure fixes don't break other tests
   - Verify that all agent-related API endpoints still function correctly
   - Test the API manually using tools like Postman or curl to confirm test accuracy
