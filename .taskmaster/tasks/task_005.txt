# Task ID: 5
# Title: Develop REST API Layer
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: low
# Description: This task is deferred until after core functionality is complete. The REST API layer will provide an HTTP-based API abstracting blockchain complexity, with authentication, real-time updates, and comprehensive endpoint coverage for agent discovery and management using the AgentRecord data model.
# Details:
Development of the Fastify API server and agent-focused endpoints is postponed until all core system features are delivered. When resumed, the implementation will follow the agent-api-endpoints.md specification, including endpoints for agent discovery, management, and metadata retrieval. The API will use the AgentRecord data model and incorporate Fastify-specific features such as plugins for authentication (JWT and API key management), JSON Schema validation, request/response lifecycle hooks, decorators for dependency injection, rate limiting, and comprehensive error handling. Deployment will utilize Docker containers and environment-based configuration. The focus will remain on robust agent discovery mechanisms and efficient agent data retrieval leveraging Fastify's high-performance architecture.

# Test Strategy:
Testing for the REST API layer will commence after core functionality is complete. Planned tests include API testing with Postman/Jest for all agent endpoints, load testing for concurrent agent queries, authentication and authorization testing with Fastify plugins, performance testing for agent discovery queries, Fastify-specific testing for plugin integration and hook execution, and JSON Schema validation for all request/response payloads using the AgentRecord model.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set Up Fastify API Server and Agent Endpoints [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initialize the Fastify server and implement REST endpoints for agent management following agent-api-endpoints.md specification, using AgentRecord data model for all responses.
### Details:
Create a Fastify project structure. Define routes for GET /agents (with filtering/search), GET /agents/{agentId}, POST /agents/discovery, GET /agents/owner/{ownerAddress}, GET /agents/categories, and GET /agents/skills. Implement AgentRecord data model exactly as specified in documentation. Ensure modular route organization for scalability.

Successfully implemented Fastify API server with all required agent endpoints. Server includes: 

1. Complete Fastify server setup with middleware (CORS, rate limiting, JWT auth, error handling)
2. Full AgentRecord data model matching specification 
3. Modular route structure in src/routes/agents.ts
4. All required REST endpoints:
   - GET /api/v1/agents (list with filtering/pagination)
   - GET /api/v1/agents/{agentId} (agent details)
   - POST /api/v1/agents/discovery (advanced discovery)
   - GET /api/v1/agents/owner/{ownerAddress} (agents by owner)
   - GET /api/v1/agents/categories (available categories)
   - GET /api/v1/agents/skills (available skills)

5. Complete TypeScript types and interfaces
6. Mock data service layer for development
7. Comprehensive request validation with JSON schemas
8. Proper error handling and logging
9. Health check endpoint at /health

Build and type checking pass successfully. Ready for testing and deployment.

## 3. Add Request Validation, Error Handling, and Middleware [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Apply JSON Schema validation to all request bodies and query parameters for agent endpoints. Implement Fastify hooks for request/response lifecycle management and custom error schemas for consistent error responses.
### Details:
Define JSON Schemas for each agent endpoint including AgentRecord response schema. Use Fastify's built-in validation and hooks (onRequest, preHandler, onSend) for middleware logic. Create custom error handlers for unified error formatting.
