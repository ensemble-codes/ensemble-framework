# Task ID: 1
# Title: Deploy Core Smart Contracts on Base Networks
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Deploy the foundational smart contracts for Service Registry, Agent Registry, and Task Registry on Base mainnet and Sepolia testnet with upgradeable patterns
# Details:
Implement and deploy smart contracts using OpenZeppelin's upgradeable proxy patterns. Create ServiceRegistry.sol for service catalog management, AgentRegistry.sol for agent registration and reputation tracking, and TaskRegistry.sol for decentralized task mempool. Include escrow functionality for payments and multi-token support. Use Hardhat for deployment with network-specific configurations for Base and Base Sepolia. Implement gas optimization techniques and emergency pause mechanisms.

# Test Strategy:
Deploy to testnet first with comprehensive unit tests using Hardhat. Test upgrade mechanisms, gas consumption analysis, and integration testing with mock scenarios. Perform security audit simulation and stress testing with high-frequency operations.
