# Task ID: 16
# Title: Implement REST API endpoints by integrating with the Ensemble SDK
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Connect agent routes to actual SDK methods for fetching agent data from blockchain, handle error cases, and ensure proper data transformation between SDK responses and API response formats.
# Details:
1. Install and configure the @ensemble/sdk package in the REST API project, ensuring proper initialization with Base mainnet and Sepolia testnet configurations.

2. Replace all mock agent data endpoints with real SDK integration:
   - Update GET /agents endpoint to use sdk.getAgents() method
   - Modify GET /agents/:id to use sdk.getAgent(id) for individual agent retrieval
   - Connect POST /agents to sdk.registerAgent() for new agent registration
   - Update PUT/PATCH /agents/:id to use sdk.updateAgent() methods
   - Implement DELETE /agents/:id using sdk.deregisterAgent()

3. Implement comprehensive error handling:
   - Catch blockchain network errors and return appropriate HTTP status codes (503 for network issues, 404 for not found, 400 for invalid parameters)
   - Add retry logic for transient network failures with exponential backoff
   - Create standardized error response format with error codes and user-friendly messages
   - Handle gas estimation failures and transaction timeout scenarios

4. Implement data transformation layer:
   - Create mapping functions to convert SDK response objects to API response format
   - Ensure consistent field naming and data types across API responses
   - Add data validation for incoming requests before passing to SDK methods
   - Implement response caching for frequently accessed agent data to reduce blockchain calls

5. Add proper async/await handling throughout all endpoints with appropriate error propagation and logging for debugging blockchain interactions.

# Test Strategy:
1. Integration testing with testnet deployment:
   - Test all CRUD operations against deployed smart contracts on Base Sepolia
   - Verify that API responses match actual on-chain agent data
   - Test agent registration, updates, and deregistration workflows end-to-end

2. Error handling validation:
   - Simulate network failures by disconnecting from blockchain nodes
   - Test timeout scenarios with long-running transactions
   - Verify proper HTTP status codes and error messages for various failure modes
   - Test retry logic with intermittent network issues

3. Data transformation verification:
   - Compare SDK response objects with API response format to ensure proper mapping
   - Test edge cases like missing optional fields and null values
   - Validate response schema compliance with OpenAPI documentation

4. Performance testing:
   - Measure response times for blockchain data fetching vs previous mock data
   - Test concurrent request handling and rate limiting
   - Verify caching effectiveness for repeated agent data requests

5. End-to-end workflow testing:
   - Test complete agent lifecycle from registration through task execution
   - Verify integration with existing authentication and authorization systems
   - Test API functionality with real blockchain transactions and gas costs
