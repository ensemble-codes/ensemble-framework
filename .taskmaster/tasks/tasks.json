Cross-environment testing:\n    - Verify documentation works in development, staging, and production\n    - Test that environment-specific configurations are correctly applied\n    - Ensure documentation URLs and references are environment-aware",

        "details": "1. Refactor each REST API endpoint to utilize the @ensemble/sdk TypeScript SDK for all agent, task, proposal, and payment operations, replacing any mock or static data sources.\n2. Ensure all endpoints interact with the deployed smart contracts on Base mainnet and Sepolia testnet, leveraging the SDK's async/await APIs for blockchain reads and writes.\n3. Implement robust error handling for blockchain/network failures, including retries and clear error responses for clients.\n4. Optimize endpoint performance by minimizing redundant blockchain calls and leveraging SDK features such as caching or batching where available.\n5. Ensure secure handling of wallet credentials and private keys, following best practices for server-side blockchain integrations (e.g., environment variables, secure vaults).\n6. Update API response schemas to reflect real data structures returned by the SDK and smart contracts, ensuring consistency with OpenAPI documentation.\n7. Add logging and monitoring for all blockchain interactions to aid in debugging and operational visibility.\n8. Coordinate with the OpenAPI documentation task to ensure all changes are accurately reflected in the API docs.\n\nBest practices include using dependency injection for the SDK client, isolating blockchain logic in service layers, and writing integration tests that connect to a testnet environment. Consider using middleware for authentication and request validation, and ensure all endpoints are covered by automated tests.",
        "testStrategy": "- Write integration tests for all updated endpoints using a testnet deployment, verifying that data returned matches on-chain state and that all CRUD operations function as expected.\n- Simulate blockchain failures and network errors to confirm robust error handling and user-facing error messages.\n- Use mock wallets and test accounts to validate agent registration, task discovery, proposal submission, and payment flows end-to-end.\n- Confirm that API responses match the updated OpenAPI specification and that no mock data remains in the codebase.\n- Review logs and monitoring dashboards to ensure all blockchain interactions are traceable and errors are captured.",
