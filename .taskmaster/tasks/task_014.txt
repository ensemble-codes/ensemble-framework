# Task ID: 14
# Title: Add Swagger/OpenAPI Documentation for REST API Endpoints
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement comprehensive Swagger/OpenAPI documentation for all REST API endpoints with an interactive UI for testing and API exploration.
# Details:
1. Select and install appropriate OpenAPI tooling based on the existing backend framework (e.g., Swagger UI, ReDoc, or Stoplight):
   - For Node.js/Express: use swagger-jsdoc and swagger-ui-express
   - For Python/Flask: use flask-restx or flask-swagger-ui
   - For Java Spring: use SpringFox or SpringDoc

2. Create a base OpenAPI specification document (openapi.yaml or openapi.json) with:
   - API metadata (title, version, description, contact information)
   - Server configurations for different environments
   - Security scheme definitions (JWT, API keys, OAuth2)
   - Common response schemas and error formats

3. Document all existing REST API endpoints with:
   - Detailed path descriptions and operation summaries
   - Request parameters (path, query, header)
   - Request body schemas with examples
   - Response schemas with status codes and examples
   - Authentication requirements

4. Implement code annotations or decorators in the API controllers/handlers to:
   - Generate OpenAPI specifications from code comments
   - Ensure documentation stays in sync with implementation
   - Include validation rules and constraints

5. Set up the interactive documentation UI:
   - Configure Swagger UI with custom themes matching application branding
   - Enable the "Try it out" feature for API testing
   - Add authorization UI components for authenticated endpoints
   - Configure CORS settings to allow documentation access

6. Implement documentation for specific API categories:
   - Agent management endpoints
   - Task creation and management
   - Authentication and identity endpoints
   - Blockchain interaction endpoints
   - Analytics and monitoring endpoints

7. Add examples and use cases for common API workflows:
   - Create sample requests for typical user journeys
   - Document request/response pairs for complex operations
   - Include authentication flow examples

8. Implement API versioning strategy in the documentation:
   - Document deprecation policies and timelines
   - Provide migration guides between API versions
   - Support multiple API versions in the documentation UI

9. Integrate the documentation into the CI/CD pipeline:
   - Validate OpenAPI specification during builds
   - Generate updated documentation on deployment
   - Publish documentation to a dedicated developer portal

10. Implement documentation for error handling:
    - Document all possible error codes and messages
    - Provide troubleshooting guidance for common errors
    - Include rate limiting and throttling information

# Test Strategy:
1. Validate OpenAPI specification compliance:
   - Use tools like Spectral or OpenAPI validator to check specification correctness
   - Verify that the OpenAPI document adheres to the OpenAPI 3.0 or 3.1 specification
   - Ensure all required fields are present and properly formatted

2. Test documentation generation:
   - Verify that code annotations correctly generate OpenAPI specifications
   - Check that changes to API endpoints are automatically reflected in documentation
   - Test the documentation build process in different environments

3. Verify interactive UI functionality:
   - Test the Swagger UI in different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
   - Verify that the "Try it out" feature works for all endpoints
   - Test authentication flows within the documentation UI
   - Check that request/response examples are correctly displayed

4. Conduct comprehensive API testing through the documentation UI:
   - Test all endpoints using the interactive documentation
   - Verify that responses match the documented schemas
   - Test error scenarios and verify error documentation accuracy
   - Check that all parameters and request bodies work as documented

5. Perform security testing on the documentation:
   - Verify that sensitive information is not exposed in examples
   - Test that authentication tokens are properly handled
   - Ensure that the documentation itself doesn't introduce security vulnerabilities

6. Conduct user acceptance testing:
   - Have developers use the documentation to implement API clients
   - Collect feedback on documentation clarity and completeness
   - Verify that the documentation helps reduce onboarding time

7. Test documentation accessibility:
   - Verify that the documentation meets WCAG accessibility standards
   - Test screen reader compatibility
   - Check color contrast and text readability

8. Performance testing:
   - Measure documentation load time and rendering performance
   - Test documentation with large API specifications
   - Verify that the interactive UI remains responsive with complex schemas

9. Integration testing:
   - Verify that the documentation integrates properly with the main application
   - Test that API changes trigger documentation updates
   - Check that documentation links correctly to other developer resources

10. Cross-environment testing:
    - Verify documentation works in development, staging, and production
    - Test that environment-specific configurations are correctly applied
    - Ensure documentation URLs and references are environment-aware
